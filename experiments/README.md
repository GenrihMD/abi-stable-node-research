# Experiments

This section contains a series of experiments that I did to find the right process to create a native add-on using Go.

- **[Use C/C++ library](/experiments/0_c_lib_to_node)**
- **[Export Go function to Node](/experiments/1_export_go_to_node)**
- **[Import C code in Go and export to Node](/experiments/2_import_c_export_go_to_node)**
- **[Import C library in Go and export to Node](/experiments/3_import_c_lib_export_go_to_c)**
- **[Use C library stub in Go and real library in C](/experiments/4_import_c_lib_stub_export_go_to_c)**
- **[Use C library stub in Go and real library in Node](/experiments/5_use_c_lib_stub_export_go_to_node)**
- **[Use N-API library stub in Go](/experiments/6_use_napi_lib_stub_export_go_to_node)**
- **[Use N-API library in Go and export all in Node](/experiments/7_use_napi_lib_stub_export_go_to_node)**
