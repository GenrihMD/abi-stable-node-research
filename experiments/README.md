# Experiments

This section contains a series of experiments that I did to find the right process to create a native add-on using Go.

- **[Use C/C++ library](/experiments/0_c_lib_to_node)**
- **[Export Go function to Node.js](/experiments/1_export_go_to_node)**
- **[Import C code in Go and export to Node.js](/experiments/2_import_c_export_go_to_node)**
- **[Import C library in Go and export to Node.js](/experiments/3_import_c_lib_export_go_to_c)**
- **[Use C library stub in Go and real library in C](/experiments/4_import_c_lib_stub_export_go_to_c)**
- **[Use C library stub in Go and real library in Node.js](/experiments/5_use_c_lib_stub_export_go_to_node)**
- **[# Use C library stub in Go and and real library in Node.js setting the include dir](/experiments/6_use_c_lib_stub_include_dir)**
